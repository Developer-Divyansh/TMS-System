# Fixes Applied - Rota Management System

## Date: October 17, 2025

## Issue 1: Dashboard Quick Actions Not Working ❌ → ✅

### Problem:
The Quick Actions on the dashboard were linking to non-existent pages:
- "Submit Timesheet" → `/timesheets/submit` (doesn't exist)
- "Create Shift" → `/shifts/create` (doesn't exist)
- "Update Profile" → `/profile` (doesn't exist)
- "View Schedule" → `/rota` (exists ✓)

### Solution:
Updated the Quick Actions to link to actual existing pages:
1. **"Manage Timesheets"** → `/timesheets` (Works for all users)
2. **"Manage Shifts"** → `/rota` (Admin/Manager only)
3. **"Manage Users"** → `/users` (All users can view)
4. **"View Schedule"** → `/rota` (All users)

### File Modified:
- `/frontend/src/pages/dashboard/index.tsx`

## Issue 2: No Logout Button on Sidebar ❌ → ✅

### Problem:
- Logout button was only visible in mobile header
- Desktop sidebar had no logout option
- Mobile sidebar had no logout option

### Solution:
Added a comprehensive user section at the bottom of both sidebars with:
- **User Avatar** (initials in a circular badge)
- **User Name** (First Name + Last Name)
- **User Role** (Admin/Manager/Staff)
- **Logout Button** (with 🚪 icon)

### Features Added:
```tsx
✓ User avatar with initials (e.g., "AU" for Admin User)
✓ Full name display
✓ Role badge
✓ Logout button with icon
✓ Clean border separation from navigation
✓ Responsive on both mobile and desktop
```

### File Modified:

## Issue 3: Login Shows Loading, Requires Reload ❌ → ✅

### Problem:
After logging in, the dashboard page showed infinite loading spinner. Only after refreshing the page would it display properly.

### Root Cause:
1. **AuthContext**: The `login` function wasn't setting `isLoading` back to `false` before redirecting to dashboard
2. **Dashboard**: The component's loading state depended on user data being available, but wasn't handling the initial state properly

### Solution:
**Fixed AuthContext (`/frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`):**
- Set `isLoading = false` BEFORE redirecting to dashboard
- Ensured state updates happen in correct order:
  1. Store token and user in localStorage
  2. Set axios headers
  3. Update React state (token, user)
  4. Set isLoading to false
  5. Then redirect to dashboard

**Fixed Dashboard (`/frontend/src/pages/dashboard/index.tsx`):**
- Changed the useEffect to always run `fetchDashboardData()` 
- Added early return with `setIsLoading(false)` if user is not available yet
- Ensures loading state is properly managed even when user data isn't ready

### Technical Details:
```tsx
// Before (Problem):
setToken(newToken);
setUser(userData);
await router.push('/dashboard'); // Loading state still true!

// After (Fixed):
setToken(newToken);
setUser(userData);
setIsLoading(false);  // ✅ Set to false BEFORE redirect
await router.push('/dashboard');
```

### Testing:
1. ✅ Login with any credentials
2. ✅ Dashboard loads immediately (no infinite spinner)
3. ✅ No need to refresh the page
4. ✅ All dashboard data loads correctly
