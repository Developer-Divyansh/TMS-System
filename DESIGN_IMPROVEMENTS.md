## Design Principles Applied

### 1. **Visual Hierarchy**
- Used font sizes: `text-3xl` for titles, `text-xl` for section headers, `text-base` for content
- Bold weights for important information
- Color coding for different states and actions

### 2. **Spacing & Breathing Room**
- Consistent use of `mb-8` for major sections
- `space-y-4/5` for form fields and list items
- Generous padding in cards (`px-6 py-6 sm:p-8`)

### 3. **Color Psychology**
- 🔵 Blue: Informational (shifts, notifications)
- 🟢 Green: Success/positive (approved, clock in)
- 🔴 Red: Important/negative (rejected, clock out)
- 🟡 Amber: Warning/attention (notifications)
- 🟣 Purple/Indigo: Analytics (hours tracking)

### 4. **Micro-interactions**
- Hover effects on cards and buttons
- Transition animations (duration-200)
- Pulse animation for new notifications
- Shadow changes on hover

### 5. **Responsive Design**
- Mobile-first grid layouts
- Responsive button sizing (`w-full sm:w-auto`)
- Flexible spacing that adapts to screen size

### 6. **Accessibility**
- Clear visual indicators
- Sufficient color contrast
- Icon + text combinations
- Logical tab order
